and from one place to another … a procession is held on this day, in which the
Litany of Saints is said with its accompanying prayers. The petitions of the
litany are not doubled.

83\. If a procession cannot be held, … special supplications [may be said],
which shall include the Litany of the Saints and the other prayers customarily
said in procession.

84\. All those who are bound to the recitation of the divine office, but do
not take part in the procession or in the other special supplications
mentioned in the preceding section, must say the Litany of the Saints with its
prayers, in Latin, on this day.

85\. If, according to the custom of the place, the Litany of the Saints with
its prayers is said in the vernacular tongue along with the faithful, in
procession or as a part of the other special supplications, those who are
bound to the recitation of the divine office and who actually take part in
these supplications do not have to repeat these prayers in Latin.

86\. The rogation Mass is regularly to be said after the procession…. It is
fitting, however, that the rogation Mass be said even after the special
supplications which take the place of the procession, even if these services
are held in the evening. [It is a II class votive Mass, per RG 346.]",https://1962ordo.today/day/st-mark-2/
